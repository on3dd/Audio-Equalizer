# Audio-Equalizer

Simple audio equalizer via p5.js (a bit unstable xD)

__Don't skip track untill it's loaded! It'll crash preloader!__

Sometimes browsers blocks autoplay when song is loaded and you have to write song.play() in console.

There is a bug with autoplay that I don't want to fix for a long time, although it should be pretty easy
